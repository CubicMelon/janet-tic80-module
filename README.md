# janet-tic80-module
Simple janet module that provides all TIC-80 functions for visibility in editing text carts or testing.

TIC-80, the excellent fantasy computer for making, playing and sharing tiny games that supports many languages including Janet can be found [here on Github](https://github.com/nesbox/TIC-80).

If this module is installed through jpm, appears as "tic80-headers", but is still used via `(import tic80)`.

Programs intended for TIC-80 can be executed in Janet with this module. Calls to the TIC-80 API will result in the API function and all of its related arguments being printed to the console.
